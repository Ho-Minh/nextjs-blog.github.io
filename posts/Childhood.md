This page is supposed to give you **an insight into my childhood** but it was quite uneventful apart from some special events I don't want to remember :V
- When I was 4, **a motorbike hit me in the head** and I had to have my head sewn, that was the first time I experienced a surgery. Since then, I didn't have to undergo any other type of surgery
- At the age of 6, I **moved to HCM city** and started living here since then
- Then I **went to Tran Dai Nghia high school for the gifted** and studied there from grade 6 to grade 9
- Afterwards, I passed the entrance test and got admitted to **VNU - High school for the gifted in 2020 and I'm currently still studying here**.
